# Iris Classifier 🌸🤖

A professional **beginner-friendly Machine Learning project** designed to classify iris flowers using the famous [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/code/drisrarahmad/iris-flower-dataset).  
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of **supervised learning for classification**, implemented with **Linear Regression** and enhanced by **feature scaling** to improve model accuracy and robustness.  

It is intended as a guided, reproducible project for those starting in Machine Learning, while maintaining production-ready structure and best practices for deployment and experimentation.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Introduce **supervised learning** concepts in a real-world dataset.
- Implement a **classification task** using **Linear Regression**.
- Apply **feature scaling** for improving prediction accuracy.
- Demonstrate **reproducibility and professional project structure** for ML workflows.
- Provide export options for models across formats (Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).
